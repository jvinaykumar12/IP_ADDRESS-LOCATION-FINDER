You can find the location of an ip address in the map. You can also the locations of bulk ip address by typing the ip address with space between them.
One special feature of this project is you can copy paste the list of IP address from TORRENT peer to peer connection and copy paste them directly in torrent 
compatible search bar in the web app and you don't need to clear the ports of the ip address, it will automatically filter the port numbers.
